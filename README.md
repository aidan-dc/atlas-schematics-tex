# atlas-schematics-tex
A few schematics of the ATLAS detector that I made for my qualifying exam presentation.

Can be easily imported and recreated in overleaf or whatever LaTeX processor of your choice assuming it has access to Tikz.

Any credit to this repository or with my name would be greatly appreciated! :)
